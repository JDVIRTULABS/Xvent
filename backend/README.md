# xVent Backend Review

This document summarizes the findings of the backend review for the xVent project.

## Potential Issues and Improvements

### 1. API Endpoints
- **Missing Endpoints**: Ensure all necessary CRUD endpoints for Users, Posts, Events, Bookmarks, and Notifications are implemented.
- **Incorrect Implementation**: Verify that the existing endpoints are correctly implemented and follow RESTful conventions.

### 2. Database Schema
- **Schema Mismatch**: Check if the database schemas for Users, Posts, and Events match the specifications provided in the project overview.
- **Data Types**: Ensure that the data types for each field in the schemas are appropriate.

### 3. Authentication and Authorization
- **Missing Authentication**: Implement user authentication to protect sensitive data.
- **Missing Authorization**: Implement authorization to control access to specific resources based on user roles.

### 4. Data Validation
- **Missing Validation**: Implement data validation to prevent invalid data from being stored in the database.
- **Validation Rules**: Define appropriate validation rules for each field in the database schemas.

### 5. Error Handling
- **Missing Error Handling**: Implement error handling to gracefully handle exceptions and provide informative error messages to the client.
- **Error Codes**: Use appropriate HTTP error codes to indicate the type of error that occurred.

### 6. Real-time Updates
- **Missing Real-time Updates**: Implement real-time updates for notifications and other dynamic data using WebSockets or a similar technology.

### 7. Code Structure and Organization
- **Poor Code Structure**: Refactor the code to improve its structure and organization.
- **Lack of Documentation**: Add comments and documentation to make the code easier to understand and maintain.
